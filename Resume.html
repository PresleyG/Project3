Cyber security systems and principles are designed to safeguard websites and web applications from attackers seeking to disrupt, delay, alter or redirect the flow of data. As we progress into the future different methods of hacking will be introduced/enhanced, hence comapnies will require more workers specialized in cyber security.</p>
