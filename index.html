      <h2> About the author </h2>
        <p> Hello viewers! My name is Presley George and I am a Sophomore at Illinois Institute of technology studying Computer Science. I am an international student coming from the United Arab Emirates. I can read and write or speak five languages: English, French, Arabic, Hindi and Tamil. I am very much intrested in cyber security and would like to join a company to help protect my company's computer networks and systems. I am looking forward to mastering html and the other scripting languages by the end of this course and have a website setup for my blog if I decide to make one.In my leisure time I would read fictional books or watch movies. I would often go to coding events to help enhance my understanding of coding and also how groups function together in order to finish a project. </p>
      <h2>Favorite sport</h2>
        <p>My favourite sport is Football. I enjoy watching and playing football, mainly because of the techniques and the tactics used during the match. The primary team I support is called Real Madrid which is a football club in the spanish League(La Liga). The team consists of key players responsible for the 13 UCl(UEFA Champion League) trpohies which is a huge achievement in footbal. The UCL is considered one of the biggest and most popular competition in the world. The picture below shows the current starting 11 of the club.</p>
